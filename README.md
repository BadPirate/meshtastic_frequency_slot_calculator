# BadPirate - meshtastic_frequency_slot_calculator

Fork of [heypete](https://github.com/heypete/meshtastic_frequency_slot_calculator) repo of the same name.

Has the same features +

- [HTML / Web / JS Version](https://github.com/heypete/meshtastic_frequency_slot_calculator/pull/3) - Ability to see slot calc in realtime in a nice web-ui, just open index.html locally

## Motivation

In the US region, Meshtastic uses the `LONG_FAST` [modem preset](https://meshtastic.org/docs/configuration/radio/lora/#modem-preset) by default. This works well in many areas, but I live in the San Francisco Bay Area which has many nodes and thus the [local group BayMe.sh](https://bayme.sh/) has recommended that users use the `MEDIUM_SLOW` preset instead to minimize network congestion.

[BayMe.sh provides instructions to set up one's node to use that configuration](https://bayme.sh/docs/getting-started/recommended-settings/) on the primary channel. If one keeps the [frequency slot](https://meshtastic.org/docs/configuration/radio/lora/#frequency-slot) set to the default value of `0`, Meshtastic will use a hash-based algorithm for determining the frequency slot corresponding to that channel name. However, it can be desirable to [use a private primary channel and the default as a secondary channel](https://meshtastic.org/docs/configuration/tips/#creating-a-private-primary-with-default-secondary). 

Unfortunately, there's a complication: Meshtastic uses the hash-based algorithm based only on the name of the [*primary channel*](https://meshtastic.org/docs/configuration/radio/channels/) and the number of frequency slots in that region. Put simply, both the primary and any secondary channels share the same frequency slot as the primary channel.

When a node is configured to use the default `LONG_FAST` modem preset, the default primary channel name is `LongFast`[^1]  In the US, the `LongFast` channel uses frequency slot `20` (906.875 MHz). If one uses a private primary channel with a different name and moves the default `LongFast` channel to a secondary channel, they need to explicitly set the frequency slot for the primary channel to `20` (for `LongFast`) in order to see the default traffic on the secondary channel.

I was interested in setting up a private primary channel and moving the defaults to a secondary channel, but I did not know the frequency slot for the `MediumSlow` channel (the name of the default channel for the `MEDIUM_SLOW` modem preset). Using `20` wouldn't work, since that's the slot for `LongFast`, not `MediumSlow`. In order to get the local `MediumSlow` traffic and participate in the mesh, I needed to know the frequency slot for the `MediumSlow` channel.

Fortunately, Meshtastic is open source and I was able to [read the source](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/blob/f6ed10f3298abf6896892ca7906d3231c8b3f567/src/mesh/RadioInterface.cpp) and implement the frequency slot calculation algorithm in python so I could calculate the slot for the `MediumSlow` channel. It turns out the slot for `MediumSlow` is `52`.

## Traps for New Players
Since the frequency slot value depends only on the channel name and the number of frequency slots in the region (104, in the US), it's possible calculate the frequency slot for any arbitrary channel name, even ones not associated with the built-in modem presets. However, ***the modem presets, channel names, and frequency slots all must exactly match those of other people one wishes to communicate with***.

For example, it's possible to configure your Meshtastic node to use the `LONG_FAST` modem preset[^2] with slot `52` (which correponds to the `MediumSlow` channel name), but that won't allow one to communicate with people using the `MEDIUM_SLOW` modem preset even if they are also using the `MediumSlow` channel name. I can't think of any reason why someone would *want* to do that, but I wanted to mention that it's possible in case someone accidentally does it and wonders why they can't communicate with anyone.

## JavaScript API

The `frequency_calculator.js` file provides a JavaScript implementation that can be used in browsers or Node.js:

```javascript
// Include the script
<script src="frequency_calculator.js"></script>

// Calculate frequency slot
const result = window.MeshtasticFrequencyCalculator.calculateFrequencySlot(
    'US',        // region
    'LongFast',  // channel name
    null         // custom bandwidth (optional)
);

console.log(result);
// {
//   region: 'US',
//   regionDescription: 'North America - 915 MHz ISM Band',
//   frequencyRange: '902.0 - 928.0 MHz',
//   channelName: 'LongFast',
//   numFreqSlots: 104,
//   frequencySlot: 20,
//   selectedFrequency: 906.875,
//   bandwidth: 250

### Footnotes
[^1]: Although similarly named, the modem preset and channel name are different things entirely: the modem preset defines the bandwidth, spreading factor, and other parameters for the LoRa mdoem itself, while the channel name being essentially a chat room name.
[^2]: Or any valid, manually-configured modem settings.
